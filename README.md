# Code Art Sketch - Curl Noise Field

![Sample Sketch](./docs/commensally%20honorable%20unsighting%20-%20beseechingly%20potful%20postins.png)

Built using [@code-not-art/sketch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-not-art/sketch) from the ready to go [development template](https://github.com/code-not-art/template)

## Quick Start

After `git clone` and `npm install`, run `npm start`!

### Noteworthy Parameters

#### Precise Steps

> Warning: The image generation algorithm is not fast, it can take several seconds to render every line.

This will increase the resolution of the lines (and the drawing time) by approximately 20x. The best way to use this is to preview images with this disabled, then enable it to get a high res render for saving.

#### Color System

Set this to `palette` to use a random palette, otherwise the image is in monochrome.

#### Use Curl

By default the flow field is being generated from simplex noise without curl. To enable the curl calculation on the field enable this.

### Code Notes

#### Palette

For nicer color combos, update the sketch config to use curated palettes instead of random. Random is useful when working with highlights sometimes.

#### Noise Complexity

The flow field is being generated by a constant named `noiseA` with potential extra manipulation by `noiseB`. Changing the octaves and frequency of these noise generators will have large and immediate impacts ont he complexity of the noise in the image's flow field.

A potential place for improvement is to expose to the parameters the octaves, frequency, and maybe a parameter for scaling position in the noise field.

### Keyboard Controls

TLDR: Spacebar to regenerate, arrow keys to change only colour or image, S to save
